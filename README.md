Assesment Question 3

## Introduction
This is a web page developed using Visual Studio Code. The different languages and markup languages used in this project include C#, HTML,CSS and JavaScript. There is also a SQL database that stores information. 

For this assesment I had to create a web page for a figurative restaurant that displays a menu list available.The web page is required to suggest various other available menu items as the user is picking a specific item and collapse the menu if the user unselects an item.
